# AntiDeletedAccountsBot (ADAb)
Automatically kick deleted accounts

## FAQ
1.  A user deleted their account, why hasn't the bot kicked them yet?

*  ADAb only checks for deleted accounts ONCE per hour at most.  And it will only check if a message was sent to the group.  This behaviour will keep the bot from slowing down, and filters out inactive groups.
