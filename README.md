# AntiDeletedAccountsBot (ADAb)
Automatically kick deleted accounts


## FAQ
1.  A user deleted their account, why hasn't the bot kicked them yet?

*  ADAb only checks for deleted accounts ONCE per hour at most.  And it will only check for deleted accounts if a message was sent to the group.  This behaviour will keep the bot from slowing down, and filters out inactive groups.

2.  Does ADAb kick or ban deleted accounts?

*  ADAb kicks deleted accounts (ban + unban).

3.  Does ADAb work in channels?

*  Yes.  It doesn't matter what permission you give it in broadcast channels, all channel admins have the permission to kick/ban.
